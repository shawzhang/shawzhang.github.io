Sample content: I’ve been building for the web since the first generation of HTML — growing from early web development into full-stack engineering and database administration. Over the years, I’ve designed, built, and optimized end-to-end systems connecting data, backend logic, and user experiences.

Today, I’m channeling that foundation into the next revolution: Artificial Intelligence. I’m focused on LLMs and Generative AI, creating applications that combine solid software engineering with intelligent, data-driven models.

My goal is to bridge traditional software with modern AI — building reliable, scalable, and human-centered AI systems for real-world impact.
